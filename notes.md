### Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Braneworld Scenarios**
   - Braneworld models propose the existence of extra dimensions beyond the standard 4D spacetime.
   - The *Randall-Sundrum (RS) model* and its generalizations were introduced to solve the *hierarchy problem* in particle physics, which seeks to explain why gravity is significantly weaker than the other fundamental forces.
   - *Thick brane models* are a generalization of the RS model, where a real scalar field is introduced to provide "thickness" to the brane. The scalar field forms *kink-like* structures that interpolate between different vacua in spacetime, leading to a localized brane with internal structure. These configurations are symmetric under a \(Z_2\) reflection.

#### 2. **\(f(R,Q,P)\) Gravity**
   - A modification of Einstein's General Relativity that includes higher-order curvature terms:
     - \( R \) is the Ricci scalar.
     - \( Q = R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} \) is the square of the Ricci tensor.
     - \( P = R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} \) is the square of the Riemann tensor.
   - This generalization provides a more flexible framework than standard \( f(R) \) gravity, which only involves the Ricci scalar, and models like \( f(R,G) \) gravity that include the Gauss-Bonnet term \( G \).
   
   **Action**:
   \[
   S = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{1}{4}f(R,Q,P) + L_m\right]
   \]
   where \( L_m \) represents the matter Lagrangian.

#### 3. **Research Objectives**
   - Investigate the behavior of codimension-one *thick brane* solutions in \(f(R,Q,P)\) gravity.
   - Study the influence of geometric invariants \(R\), \(Q\), and \(P\) on the scalar field profile, brane energy density, and the localization of spin-1/2 fermions and gravitinos (spin-3/2 fields).

### Theoretical Framework:

#### 1. **Action and Field Equations**
   
   The modified Einstein field equations are derived by varying the action:
   \[
   R_{MN}f_R - \frac{1}{2}g_{MN}f + H_{MN} + K_{MN} = 2T_{MN}
   \]
   where:
   - \( H_{MN} \) is a correction term involving derivatives of \( f_R \) (i.e., \( f_R = \partial f / \partial R \)):
     \[
     H_{MN} = (g_{MN}\square - \nabla_M\nabla_N)f_R
     \]
   - \( K_{MN} \) includes contributions from higher-order terms involving derivatives of \( Q \) and \( P \):
     \[
     K_{MN} = \square(f_QR_{MN}) + g_{MN}\nabla_A\nabla_B(f_QR^{AB}) + 2f_QR^A_{(M}R_{N)A} - 2\nabla_A\nabla_{(M}(f_QR^A_{N)})
     \]
     \[
     + f_PR_{ABCM}R^{ABC}_N - 4\nabla_A\nabla_B(f_PR^A_{(MN)B})
     \]
   - Here, \( f_Q = \frac{\partial f}{\partial Q} \) and \( f_P = \frac{\partial f}{\partial P} \).
   
#### 2. **Braneworld Metric**
   The braneworld scenario is studied with a 5-dimensional metric:
   \[
   ds^2 = e^{2A(y)}\eta_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu + dy^2
   \]
   - The warp factor \( A(y) \) governs how the 4D spacetime slices are embedded in the 5D bulk. For a thick brane, a standard ansatz for the warp factor is:
     \[
     A(y) = \omega \ln[\text{sech}(y)]
     \]
   - This warp factor satisfies important properties:
     - Smooth behavior near the brane core.
     - Asymptotically reproduces the RS model warp factor (\( e^{2A(y)} \rightarrow 0 \) as \( y \to \infty \)).
     - Ensures normalizability of the zero-mode graviton.

#### 3. **Scalar Field Lagrangian**
   The matter Lagrangian is described by a real scalar field that generates the thick brane:
   \[
   L_m = -\frac{1}{2}\partial_M\phi\partial^M\phi - V(\phi)
   \]
   - The scalar field evolves dynamically, and its potential \( V(\phi) \) determines the localization and thickness of the brane.

### Analysis of Gravity Models:

#### 1. **Quadratic Gravity**
   A simple model of \( f(R,Q,P) \) gravity is given by:
   \[
   f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1R^2 + k_2Q + k_3P
   \]
   - The scalar field equation derived from this form is:
     \[
     \phi'(y)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\omega \text{sech}^2(y)[-4\tanh^2(y)(2k_1(\omega(5\omega+16)+8) + k_2(2\omega(\omega+5)+5) + k_3(\omega(\omega+8)+4)) + 2(4\omega+1)\text{sech}^2(y)(16k_1+5k_2+4k_3) + 3]
     \]
   - The kink-like structure of the scalar field evolves into a *two-kink solution* as \( k_1 \) increases, and the brane begins to split, signaling the presence of an internal structure. This phenomenon is purely geometric and arises from the higher-order terms in the gravity model.

#### 2. **Cubic Gravity**
   Extending to cubic terms in \( f(R,Q,P) \):
   \[
   f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1R^3 + k_2RQ + k_3RP
   \]
   - The scalar field in cubic gravity tends to develop a *three-kink solution* as the parameters \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) are adjusted, indicating a more complex internal structure of the brane. The solution shows significant geometric influences due to the presence of cubic invariants.

#### 3. **Quartic Gravity**
   Three different quartic gravity models are studied:
   - **Model 1**: 
     \[
     f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1R^4 + k_2Q^2 + k_3P^2
     \]
   - **Model 2**: 
     \[
     f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1R^4 + k_2QP
     \]
   - **Model 3**: 
     \[
     f(R,Q,P) = R + (k_1R^2 + k_2Q + k_3P)^2
     \]
   - These models exhibit 2-kink or 3-kink scalar field solutions depending on the values of the parameters, further showcasing how higher-order curvature terms lead to richer internal structures within the brane.

### Fermion Localization:

#### 1. **Dirac Fermions (Spin-1/2)**
   The Dirac action in the bulk is given by:
   \[
   S_{1/2} = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g}(i\bar{\Psi}\Gamma^MD_M\Psi - \lambda\phi\bar{\Psi}\Psi)
   \]
   - After performing a Kaluza-Klein decomposition, the localization of left- and right-handed fermions is analyzed. The effective potentials for these fermions are:
     \[
     V_L(z) = (\lambda\phi e^A)^2 - \partial_z(\lambda\phi e^A)
     \]
     \[
     V_R(z) = (\lambda\phi e^A)^2 + \partial_z(\lambda\phi e^A)
     \]
   - Only left-handed zero modes are localized on the brane, consistent with the behavior of thick branes in general relativity.

#### 2. **Gravitino Localization (Spin-3/2)**
   The localization of the gravitino (Rarita-Schwinger field) is similarly studied. The action is:
   \[
   S_{3/2} = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g}(i\bar{\Psi}_M\Gamma^{[M}\Gamma^N\Gamma^{R]}D_N\Psi_R - \lambda\

phi\bar{\Psi}_M[\Gamma^M,\Gamma^N]\Psi_N)
   \]
   - The gravitino localization also yields only left-handed zero modes localized on the brane. The potentials for gravitino localization mirror those found for Dirac fermions.

### Key Findings:

1. **Two-Kink Solutions in Quadratic Gravity**:
   - Quadratic gravity leads to *brane splitting*, characterized by the emergence of two-kink solutions for the scalar field.

2. **Three-Kink Solutions in Cubic and Quartic Gravity**:
   - In cubic and quartic gravity models, *three-kink solutions* emerge, indicating a more complex internal structure of the brane.

3. **Fermion Localization**:
   - Only left-handed fermions and gravitinos are localized on the brane, with higher-order curvature terms in the \(f(R,Q,P)\) gravity model significantly affecting the localization profiles and internal structure of the brane.

4. **Higher-Order Curvature Influence**:
   - Higher-order terms in \(f(R,Q,P)\) gravity profoundly influence the brane structure, modifying the scalar field and energy density profiles compared to general relativity or simpler modifications like \(f(R)\) gravity.
