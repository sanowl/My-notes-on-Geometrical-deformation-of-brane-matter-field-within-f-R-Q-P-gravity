# Geometrical Deformation of Brane Matter Field within $f(R,Q,P)$ Gravity

## Key Concepts

### 1. Braneworld Scenarios
- **Braneworld models** propose the existence of extra dimensions beyond the standard 4D spacetime.
- The **Randall-Sundrum (RS) model** and its generalizations were introduced to solve the **hierarchy problem** in particle physics, which seeks to explain why gravity is significantly weaker than the other fundamental forces.
- **Thick brane models** are a generalization of the RS model, where a real scalar field is introduced to provide "thickness" to the brane. The scalar field forms **kink-like** structures that interpolate between different vacua in spacetime, leading to a localized brane with internal structure. These configurations are symmetric under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflection.

### 2. $f(R,Q,P)$ Gravity
- A modification of Einstein's General Relativity that includes higher-order curvature terms:
  - $R$ is the Ricci scalar.
  - $Q = R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$ is the square of the Ricci tensor.
  - $P = R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ is the square of the Riemann tensor.
- This generalization provides a more flexible framework than standard $f(R)$ gravity, which only involves the Ricci scalar, and models like $f(R,G)$ gravity that include the Gauss-Bonnet term $G$.

**Action**:
```math
S = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{1}{4} f(R,Q,P) + \mathcal{L}_m \right]
```
where $\mathcal{L}_m$ represents the matter Lagrangian.

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Action and Field Equations
The modified Einstein field equations are derived by varying the action:
```math
R_{MN} f_R - \frac{1}{2} g_{MN} f + H_{MN} + K_{MN} = 2 T_{MN}
```
where:
- $f_R = \frac{\partial f}{\partial R}$, $f_Q = \frac{\partial f}{\partial Q}$, and $f_P = \frac{\partial f}{\partial P}$.
- $H_{MN}$ is a correction term involving derivatives of $f_R$:
  ```math
  H_{MN} = \left( g_{MN} \Box - \nabla_M \nabla_N \right) f_R
  ```
- $K_{MN}$ includes contributions from higher-order terms involving derivatives of $Q$ and $P$:
  ```math
  \begin{aligned}
  K_{MN} = &\ \Box (f_Q R_{MN}) + g_{MN} \nabla_A \nabla_B (f_Q R^{AB}) \\
           & + 2 f_Q R^A_{\ (M} R_{N)A} - 2 \nabla_A \nabla_{(M} (f_Q R^A_{\ N)}) \\
           & + f_P R_{ABCM} R^{ABC}_{\ \ \ \ N} - 4 \nabla_A \nabla_B (f_P R^{A}_{\ (MN)}{}^{B})
  \end{aligned}
  ```

### 2. Braneworld Metric
The braneworld scenario is studied with a 5-dimensional metric:
```math
ds^2 = e^{2A(y)} \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + dy^2
```
- The warp factor $A(y)$ governs how the 4D spacetime slices are embedded in the 5D bulk. For a thick brane, a standard ansatz for the warp factor is:
  ```math
  A(y) = \omega \ln \left[ \operatorname{sech}(y) \right]
  ```
- This warp factor satisfies important properties:
  - Smooth behavior near the brane core.
  - Asymptotically reproduces the RS model warp factor ($e^{2A(y)} \rightarrow 0$ as $|y| \rightarrow \infty$).
  - Ensures normalizability of the zero-mode graviton.

### 3. Scalar Field Lagrangian
The matter Lagrangian is described by a real scalar field that generates the thick brane:
```math
\mathcal{L}_m = -\frac{1}{2} \partial_M \phi \partial^M \phi - V(\phi)
```
- The scalar field evolves dynamically, and its potential $V(\phi)$ determines the localization and thickness of the brane.

### 4. Scalar Field Equation in Quadratic Gravity
The scalar field equation derived from a simple model of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity is:
```math
\begin{aligned}
\phi'(y)^2 = &\ \frac{1}{2} \omega \, \operatorname{sech}^2(y) \Bigg[ -4 \tanh^2(y) \left( 2 k_1 \left( \omega (5\omega + 16) + 8 \right) + k_2 \left( 2\omega (\omega + 5) + 5 \right) + k_3 \left( \omega (\omega + 8) + 4 \right) \right) \\
& + 2 (4\omega + 1) \operatorname{sech}^2(y) (16 k_1 + 5 k_2 + 4 k_3) + 3 \Bigg]
\end{aligned}
```

## Analysis of Gravity Models

### 1. Quadratic Gravity
A simple model of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity is given by:
```math
f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1 R^2 + k_2 Q + k_3 P
```

### 2. Cubic Gravity
Extending to cubic terms in $f(R,Q,P)$:
```math
f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1 R^3 + k_2 R Q + k_3 R P
```

### 3. Quartic Gravity
Three different quartic gravity models are studied:
- **Model 1**: 
  ```math
  f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1 R^4 + k_2 Q^2 + k_3 P^2
  ```
- **Model 2**: 
  ```math
  f(R,Q,P) = R + k_1 R^4 + k_2 Q P
  ```
- **Model 3**: 
  ```math
  f(R,Q,P) = R + \left( k_1 R^2 + k_2 Q + k_3 P \right)^2
  ```

## Fermion Localization

### 1. Dirac Fermions (Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$)
The Dirac action in the bulk is given by:
```math
S_{1/2} = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g} \left( i \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^M D_M \Psi - \lambda \phi \bar{\Psi} \Psi \right)
```
- After performing a Kaluza-Klein decomposition, the effective potentials for these fermions are:
  ```math
  V_L(z) = \left( \lambda \phi e^{A} \right)^2 - \partial_z \left( \lambda \phi e^{A} \right)
  ```
  ```math
  V_R(z) = \left( \lambda \phi e^{A} \right)^2 + \partial_z \left( \lambda \phi e^{A} \right)
  ```

### 2. Gravitino Localization (Spin-$\frac{3}{2}$)
The action for the localization of the gravitino (Rarita-Schwinger field) is:
```math
S_{3/2} = \int d^5x \sqrt{-g} \left( i \bar{\Psi}_M \Gamma^{[M} \Gamma^N \Gamma^{R]} D_N \Psi_R - \lambda \phi \bar{\Psi}_M \left[ \Gamma^M, \Gamma^N \right] \Psi_N \right)
